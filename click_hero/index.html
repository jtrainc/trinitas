<!-- By setting the [lang] attribute to "en", we inform any application or
 process that may access this content that our page is in English. This is a
 good practice to have, and is useful in many scarios. For example, this is
 how a user from another country might be informed by their browser that the
 content can be translated into their language. -->

    <!-- By declaring `UTF-8`, we ensure that our webpage can handle special
     characters, such as accented letters (e.g., é, ñ) or symbols (e.g., €,
     ©), without rendering issues. If we don't use the right character set
     encoding, these characters (and others) could be rendered as �. By
     using UTF-8, we can include English, Latin, Greek, Math Symbols, and so
     much more all on the same page. UTF-8 supports 1,112,064 different
     types of characters, symbols, and more. -->

     it is being viewed on (e.g., a laptop, a tablet, a phone, etc.). Phones
     often have 2x more pixels, so they can show sharper images in smaller
     spaces. Without this line, our page content may appear very tiny on 
     phones and other "high pixel density" displays. -->

     an external CSS file to our HTML document, enabling that file to select

    <!-- We use the [defer] attribute to tell the browser to finish building
     the page before it executes any of our JavaScript. If our code is ran before
     the rest of the page has been constructed, many of the elements we expect to
     exist will not yet have been built. -->
