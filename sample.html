      <h2>About the Club</h2>
      <p>The Trinitas Code Club is a group of Freshmen students learning to build websites and programs from scratch. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, these students explore how the web works—and how to create their own part of it.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="topics">
      <h2>Topics Covered</h2>
      <ul class="topics-list">

      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="logic">
      <h2>Logic & Programming</h2>
      <p>Programming is built on the foundation of logic. Just as formal Logic teaches students how to reason with clarity and structure, programming trains the mind to solve problems methodically. Writing code is like creating a set of instructions that must be perfectly logical—computers don’t guess, they do exactly what you tell them.</p>
      <p>This class connects classical education with modern skills, allowing students to apply what they know about logical inference, patterns, and structure to build real-world tech.</p>
